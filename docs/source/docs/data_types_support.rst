Data types support
==================
JSON transport supported types are limited by JSON type system described in http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt.

XML-RPC specification contains explicit type information. As a result, more types are supported. They are described
in http://xmlrpc.scripting.com/spec.html.

In addition, Python version used in your project may change how data types are transmitted. Since django-modern-rpc
allows you to declare methods that can handle both protocols, this document describes how specific types are handled
in RPC methods in all cases (JSON or XML-RPC transport with Python 2 or Python 3).

Basic types
-----------
The basic types are handled the same way with the 2 supported protocols. Those types are:

- bool
- int
- float
- string (Python 3 only, see Strings_ for information with Python 2)

As long as a RPC method arguments or return value is of one of the above types, the behavior is consistent across all
Python version and protocols.

List and structures
-------------------
Both JSON-RPC and XML-RPC supports *lists* and *structures*. Conversion is done as follow:

 - Input data (RPC method argument)

   - *structure* is converted to Python ``dict``
   - *list* is converted to Python ``list``

 - Output data (RPC method return type)

   - Python ``dict`` is converted to *structure*
   - Python ``list`` and ``tuple`` is converted to *list*

In other words, you can use those types without any issue, it works as you expect it.

Both *lists* and *structures* can contains any combinations of elements of types defined in this documents. A *struct*
can contain another *struct* or a *list*, etc.

null and NoneType
-----------------
By default, both JSON-RPC and XML-RPC handlers will be able to return ``None`` or to take a None value as argument.
The XML handler will convert such values to ``<nil/>`` special argument. Since this type is not part of the original
specification, some XML-RPC clients may misunderstand this value. If you prefer respect the original standard, simply
define in your ``settings.py``::

   MODERNRPC_XMLRPC_ALLOW_NONE = False

As a result, the XML handler will raise a ``TypeError`` when trying to serialize a response containing a ``None`` value.

Strings
-------
If your project runs in a Python 3 environment, the behavior is consistent for XML-RPC and JSON-RPC protocol.

In a Python 2 project, XML deserializer will transmit string values as ``str`` when JSON deserializer will
produce ``unicode`` values. If this behavior is problematic in your project, you have to manually handle both cases for
each string you manipulate in your RPC methods. As an alternative, django-modern-rpc can dynamically standardize
incoming arguments to ensure contained strings are converted to have always the same type from method point of view.

.. note::

    The strings standardization apply on strings arguments, but also on list and structures. The process inspects
    recursively all arguments to perform the conversion of string values. This can be inefficient for big structures or
    lists, that's why this feature is not enabled by default.

You have 2 options to configure this process:

.. _GlobalStringStandardization:

Global String standardization (project level)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In your ``settings.py``, define the variable ``MODERNRPC_PY2_STR_TYPE`` with type value ``str`` or ``unicode``. This
will automatically converts any incoming string argument to the specified type. In such case, you will need to also
configure ``settings.MODERNRPC_PY2_STR_ENCODING`` with the strings encoding (default is ``UTF-8``)

In ``settings.py``

.. code:: python

    MODERNRPC_PY2_STR_TYPE = str
    MODERNRPC_PY2_STR_ENCODING = 'UTF-8'


In ``rpc_methods``

.. code:: python

    @rpc_method
    def print_incoming_type(data):
        """Returns a string representation of input argument type"""
        if isinstance(data, unicode):
            return 'Incoming arg is a unicode object'
        elif isinstance(data, str):
            return 'Incoming arg is a str object'

        return 'Incoming arg has type {}'.format(type(data))

In this example, calling ``print_incoming_type('abcd')`` from a Python 2 project will always return ``Incoming arg is
a str object``, no matter which protocol were used to make the request (JSON-RPC or XML-RPC)

Method level String standardization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the same way, if you need to have a different behavior for a specific RPC method, the equivalent of
``settings.MODERNRPC_PY2_STR_TYPE`` and ``settings.MODERNRPC_PY2_STR_ENCODING`` variables can be defined at method
level:

.. code:: python

    @rpc_method(str_standardization=unicode, str_standardization_encoding='UTF-8')
    def print_incoming_type(data):
        """Returns a string representation of input argument type"""
        if isinstance(data, unicode):
            return 'Incoming arg is a unicode object'
        elif isinstance(data, str):
            return 'Incoming arg is a str object'

        return 'Incoming arg has type {}'.format(type(data))

This parameters will override the global settings for a specific RPC method.

Dates
-----

In XML-RPC
^^^^^^^^^^
XML-RPC transport defines a type to handle dates and date/times: ``dateTime.iso8601``. Conversion is done as follow:

 - Input date (RPC method argument)

   - If ``settings.MODERNRPC_XMLRPC_USE_BUILTIN_TYPES = True (default)``, the date will be converted to
     ``datetime.datetime``
   - If ``settings.MODERNRPC_XMLRPC_USE_BUILTIN_TYPES = False``, the date will be converted to
     ``xmlrpc.client.DateTime`` (Python 3) or ``xmlrpclib.DateTime`` (Python 2)

 - Output date (RPC method return type)

   - Any object of type ``datetime.datetime``, ``xmlrpclib.DateTime`` or ``xmlrpc.client.DateTime`` will
     be converted to ``dateTime.iso8601`` in XML response

In JSON-RPC
^^^^^^^^^^^
JSON transport has no specific support of dates, they are transmitted as string formatted with ISO 8601 standard.
The behavior of default encoder and decoder classes is:

 - Input date (RPC method argument)

   - Dates are transmitted as standard string. Decoder will NOT try to recognize dates to apply specific treatments.
     Use

 - Output date (RPC method return type)

   - ``datetime.datetime`` objects will be automatically converted to string (format ISO 8601), so JSON-RPC clients
     will be able to handle it as usual. This behavior is due to the use of ``DjangoJSONEncoder`` as default encoder.

If you need to customize behavior of JSON encoder and/or decoder, you can specify another classes in ``settings.py``::

    MODERNRPC_JSON_DECODER = 'json.decoder.JSONDecoder'
    MODERNRPC_JSON_ENCODER = 'django.core.serializers.json.DjangoJSONEncoder'

Using helper to handle all cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To simplify date handling in your RPC methods, django-modern-rpc defines a helper to convert any object type into a
``datetime.datetime`` instance:

.. autofunction:: modernrpc.helpers.get_builtin_date

Here is an usage example:

.. code:: python

   from modernrpc.helpers import get_builtin_date

   @rpc_method()
   def add_one_month(date):
       """Adds 31 days to the given date, and returns the result."""
       return get_builtin_date(date) + datetime.timedelta(days=31)
